This was made before I knew javascript or html very well so its all in one file and its pretty hard to follow. 
I'm keeping it around because I implemented games stuff (like physics and dying) so I might use it as a reference someday.

Contact me if you have and questions.

The goal of this game is to be the best.
This means spinning the farthest. To progress
you must jump from platform to platform without
falling. Each platform you jump will increase your
score and get you ever closer to the top top.
